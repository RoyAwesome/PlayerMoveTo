# PlayerMoveTo
Adds nodes equivalent to AIMoveTo for PlayerController

`GP Move To Actor or Location` is available for gameplay abilities (only) within Unreal Engine, but requires additional components, and didn't modify the acceleration so animations don't play.

There is an additional node added to this plugin for use outside of gameplay abilities as well.

These nodes will be available with the use of this plugin:
* `Gameplay Player Move To Actor or Location`
* `Player Move To Actor or Location`

This plugin was created using Unreal 5.1

## How to Use
Clone to your project's "Plugins" folder (you may need to create this).

Then simply add the nodes described above as required.

## Versions
### 1.0.0.0
* Initial Release
